 * ========================================================================
 * FRIENDS SERVICE
 * ========================================================================
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * Manages player friend requests, buddy list, and relationship status.
 * 
 * USAGE EXAMPLE:
 * Internal service handling various social-related messages and actions 
 * within the game server's session management system.
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * Flow to adding a friend:
    1. Player A clicks on player B's character and selects "Add Friend".
        Player A sends GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTADD to the server. Player A keeps track of player B's ID.
    2. Server forwards the request to player B with CHARACTER_103_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTADDFWD.
    3. Player B receives the request, and adds it to their pending friend requests. They will see a notification in the client.
    4. Player B can now accept or deny the request.
        a. If they accept, they send GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT to the server.
        b. If they deny, they send GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTDENY to the server.
    5. Server forwards the response to player A with CHARACTER_103_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTREPLYFWD. If the sender
         is offline, we will have to go to the database directly to add the friend.
    6. Player A receives the response. If the response is an acceptance, they will add the friend to their list.
        Player A's game client will see a notification that the friend request has been accepted.

    - The protocol uses two distinct ID domains for characters:
        - Character ID — the persistent character/account-level identifier (m_characterId)
        - GameObject ID — the runtime object identifier (WizClientObject.m_globalID.m_full)
    - Field names are not sufficient to determine the ID domain. In particular, fields named GID, GlobalID, or
        similar may contain either a Character ID or a GameObject ID depending on the message and context.

    - Instances where the GameObject ID is used:
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYSTATS.TargetCharacterGID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYSTATS.BuddyID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYENTRY.ListOwnerGID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYLISTCOMPLETE.ListOwnerGID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYSTATUSUPDATE.ListOwnerGID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT.SourceObjectID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT.DestObjectID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTADD.EntryGID
            - For the initial client → server buddy request, this is the target's GameObject ID.
    - Instances where the Char ID is used:
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYENTRY.EntryGID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_IGNOREADD.CharacterGID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_IGNOREDROP.CharacterGID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_GOTOPLAYER.TargetCharacterID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT.ListOwnerGID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT.EntryGID
        - GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYSTATUSUPDATE.EntryGID

    - Consequently, buddy messages can contain both ID domains in the same message. For example, MSG_BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT uses:
        - GameObject IDs:
            - SourceObjectID — the recipient's GameObject ID
            - DestObjectID — the requester's GameObject ID
        - Character IDs:
            - ListOwnerGID — the requester's Character ID
            - EntryGID — the recipient's Character ID
    
    - GlobalID should therefore be treated as a context-dependent protocol field, not as a synonym for GameObjectID.
        For example, CharacterInfo.GlobalID contains the Character ID despite its name.

    ============ BUDDY STATS ============

    - The character window asks with `MSG_BUDDYSTATS`, sending the checksum of every block it cached on
        disk. Blocks whose checksum still matches are left out of the reply (see BuddyStatsBuilder).
    - The client only asks about friends who are online and players it can see. Online players answer
        from their own session (`MSG_BUDDYSTATSFWD`); other characters are rebuilt from the database.

    =====================================
 * 
 * TODO:
 * - Implement the `PreviousName` field in `MSG_BUDDYENTRY`.
